Version 16.10.0                                          8. October 2016


This Version is currently EXPERIMENTAL
======================================

There has been many (smaller+larger) modification everywhere in the 
application to implement the new time zone feature.

Testing was done to import tours with different file formats which 
needed some adjustments but there can still be unsolved problems which 
were not yet detected by these tests.

Already saved tours from previous versions should not be a problem 
(because the tour start time is never modified) but newly imported tours
should be observed if the tour start time is displayed correctly.

I'm not shure if all time zone descriptions on this site and the app are
understandable or are more confusing.

 
New 	
===

* Time zone

  With this version, a tour start time is now always associated with a 
  specific time zone, previously only the system time zone was used to 
  display the tour time.

  This caused the problem that a local time in Boston at 8 a.m. was 
  displayed at 14:00 o'clock in middle Europe and not at 8:00.

  A tour start time is now displayed always with the local time, no 
  math is needed any more to get it correctly.

  More info about the usage of time zones is described in the 
  preferences.

 
* Time Zone Tools 	

  - Set/remove a time zone in a tour with the tour editor
  - Set/remove a time zone for multiple tours in the tour book view
  - Select default time zone in the preferences

  These tools will NEVER change the tour start time, only the tour 
  time zone

 
Improvements 	
============

* General preference page

  - Splitted page layout into tabs
